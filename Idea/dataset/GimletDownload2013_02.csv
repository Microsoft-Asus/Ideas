If not checked out within that time it will be automatically returned to the collection and must be requested again.  3.

Can you help in any way?","Hi Jeana,     Do you have a library card? We do not have you having one under your student ID number. If you have one, you need to join your accounts to gain access to the databases. When you join your account at the circulation desk, located on the first floor of the library, then you can also change your pin number.     If you don't have a library card, you can get access to the library databases by creating an account. Here are the instructions:  From the My Account login screen, enter your name, 9-digit SJSU ID (The ""w"" is the equivalent to 00) and desired 4-digit Library PIN. You will then be asked to enter your new PIN twice.  Here is the link:  https://catalog.sjlibrary.org/patroninfo/  Please let me know if you are still having trouble. "

I know that the bill was passed in 2012 and implemented jan 1st, 2013 however for my paper I am not finding any direction on where to find research. ","First of all, I want to let you know that it may be difficult to find scholarly information about this bill. If your professor requires scholarly or peer reviewed articles for the paper, you may need to choose a separate bill. Generally there is 1-2+ year turn around from a bill passing to it appearing in the scholarly literature.    If your professor does not require scholarly articles and you still want to continue with this topic, you will probably need to focus your research on looking at the bill itself and articles in popular press resources, such as newspapers.    For information about the Bill you can use the following website: http://leginfo.ca.gov/bilinfo.html  To find the bill, make sure you change the session to ""(2011-2012) Prior"" and then you can search by Bill Number (SB 9), Author (Yee), or keywords. The results will give you information about the various amendments, analyses by different committees and groups, and voting results.    For newspaper articles our largest database is called ProQuest Newstand. You can access it via the newspaper section of my database list on the Social Work research Guide: http://libguides.sjsu.edu/content.php?pid=54788&sid=2051913    I hope this helps and let me know if you have any questions."

My topic is ""Are genetically modified foods safe?"" I need 3-6 articles, all of which must be peer reviewed, primary, and empirical."," I would recommend that you look at several resources for your upcoming presentation: Opposing Viewpoints (pro/con database that will help summarize the different positions on a topic), Academic Search Premier (broad database that will find social, economic, science, and health-related articles), and ScienceDirect (a database of scientific, medical, and technical literature).  To get to any of these resources, please click on ""Articles & Databases"" under Quick Links on the library's homepage, then the first letter of the database name, and then the name of the database.  For example, to get to Opposing Viewpoints, you would click on these series of links: Articles & Databases > O > Opposing Viewpoints.    I would recommend that you use the following search in Academic Search Premier and ScienceDirect (for Opposing Viewpoint, you may simply enter genetically modified foods):    genetically modified food* AND safe* AND health*     The asterisk (*) indicates that any other character(s) may follow.  So, safe* = safe, safes, safety.    I found this great article in ScienceDirect about the studies that have been done on animal models with respect to GMFs and attached it for your convenience.  See page 739 for a great table on what has been done and the references to those studies.  "

I am very grateful since I was about to approach this in a different manner.     As you have indicated, the libraries you stated no longer use the Interlibrary Loan process and now use what is called the ""Link +"" method which must be some software based webebsite which bypasses the Interlibrary Loan procedure.  I have to guess that this has been a cost saving effort to free up mor time for librarians to do other work.  I feel this has been a shame especially for those older generation people who have no computer and are not computer literate, a form of age discrimination.     Because I want to be able to secure other books and papers from the libraries where they are available in print or electronically, as of today I will be renewing my library card (plastic card with name and personal identification code) because the ID number has been warn off.  This would then allow me to try out the ""Link +"" system.  Frankly I will be quite surprised if this system works well and if it does, it may become very useful tool for the public.       Again thanks for your generosity of time in providing the requested journal article.   ","I appreciate your message.      To clarify, LINK+ is a book delivery service.  LINK+ is a cooperative of public, academic, and special libraries across California and Nevada that have agreed to make their books available to other LINK+ library users. Therefore, as a member of SJSU's library, I can check out books from other systems, like Contra Costa, Alameda, and City of Pleasanton.  SJSU facilitates the borrowing and it's free for the user.  To see the materials that can be borrowed through this service, please see this catalog link http://csul.iii.com/.    LINK+ does not facilitate the borrowing of articles.  Unfortunately, it appears that none of your area libraries can offer that service anymore.  Interlibrary loan is an expensive service, as each request costs an average of $25--30.  Due to the financial costs associated with this process, as well as unreliability of obtaining the requested materials, many public libraries are no longer offering this service.      I would encourage you to review your public library's electronic journal databases.  However, truly technical articles, like the one you requested below, will not generally be a journal that is held by a public library.  You may also check Google Scholar for any author pre-prints (free versions of accepted publications) and institutional repository holdings.  If the article that you're interested in was funded with public taxpayer (i.e., government grants), there is a mandate to have the resultant publications available for public review, use, and edification.  To search Google Scholar, navigate to http://scholar.google.com.  Finally, your best recourse for obtaining an article for free is to visit an area public university library that is a subscriber to that journal.  Generally, public university libraries will allow physically present individuals to use the facilities and resources.    I hope this information helps and clarifies the options that you have when seeking specific scientific articles.    "

I haven't been able to login using my sjsu library number and pin either (but i can get into the library) when overdrive asks for those.  is there a simple step by step process written down besides ""getting started"" which only gets me the app?  Is there a training I can take--maybe someone at the library can show me?  I bought a tablet just for this sort of thing and haven't been able to use it for books even once.","I am a librarian at SJSU, your message was directed to me so I can try to help you with your questions.     First of all here is a link to overdrive's complete help pages: http://overdrive.sjlibrary.org/help.htm This should be able to help you set up your devices and make sure all of your accounts are set up properly.    Second of all, most overdrive books are single user check out materials. This means that while it is an ebook, it can only be checked out by one person at a time (or one person per copy the library has bought). Users can have ebooks checked out for a couple of weeks at a time in most cases. Thus, it is very possible that there is a waitlist that you would need to add yourself to in order to get access to the book. Furthermore, once you have access to the book, it will be automatically deleted from your device once the checkout period is over.    Finally, Overdrive is a ebook vendor that is paid for by the public library, thus SJSU has no control over what material is available through overdrive nor the borrowing policies for those materials. This is also why there is no material concerning overdrive on the university library's website. Here is a link to SJPL's ebook help page for your future information: http://www.sjpl.org/ebookhelp    I hope this helps. If you find you need more assistance you may want to attend a class in person. Below are links to ebook help classes provided by SJPL.

",Both music and audiobook titles can come in two formats- MP3 (which can be returned early) and WMA (which cannot be returned early due to publisher restrictions).The title you mentioned is an MP3 Audiobook so it can be returned early. The title has been reactivated for you so please try to download it again. If that doesn't work Overdrive suggests the following steps to try and resolve the issue:    Delete the title from OMC then close the application.    Search your computer for the title and delete each instance you find.    Audiobooks are usually found in Documents > My Media > MP3 Audiobooks or WMA Audiobooks.    Delete your temporary Internet files. This step is extremely important.    Close and reopen your web browser.    Try downloading the title again. You'll find it under your account on your library's website.

"," I found the most success in finding articles in more general resources such as Academic Search Premier, OmniFile Full Text Mega, and Web of Science. I did find some articles (under 15) in more subject specific databases such as Social Services Abstracts, but those might be repeats of the general databases results.     The only databases where I was able to find more than 5 peer reviewed articles on any one country was in Academic Search Premier and Web of Science, so you may was to focus on searching in there if you plan on focusing on one country. Once you complete a search both of those databases have ways to limit by geography on the left hand side of the screen. In Academic Search premier scroll down to geography to select a location limit. In Web of Science scroll down to Countries/territories to select a specific country.    Since you don't have a particular country in mind, I would look at the results you get back for the top couple of countries (USA, Australia, Great Britain, etc.) and see which set of articles will best support your paper."

As the SJSU official representative for ICPSR has informed me (see his email below), I can either download the ICPSR data from a campus computer or if I am logged in through the Library's proxy server from off campus.     I have two questions regarding that:     1) Is it possible to save the data on the desktop etc. on a campus computer and then transfer it to my laptop via a USB memory stick?  2) If this is not an option, can you assist me with logging in on my laptop through the library's proxy server?","  To go through the library's server remotely is quite easy, it simply requires an addition to the URL. If you are on campus it should bring you right to the page, if you are offcampus it should ask you to log in with your library pin before you see the page. Here is the link: http://libaccess.sjlibrary.org/login?url=http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/3272?q=Detroit+Area+Study%2C+1995%3A+Social+Influences+on+Health%3A+Stress%2C+Racism%2C+and+Health+Protective+Services&permit[0]=AVAILABLE  In the future if you go to ICPSR's website through the library webpage you shouldn't have this issue again. You can find the link here under the full name Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)   http://library.calstate.edu/sanjose/databases/alphabetical#I    Also, it looks like even when you log in you still need to create an account ICPSR to download the data.    It looks like the datasets are just file downloads, so you should be able to download and save without any issues."

I'm not sure if you're looking for new materials that are biodegradable or if you're looking for existing products.  ScienceDirect will cover both of these aspects and even indicate which crops might be potential contenders for delivering the necessary raw materials.      Are you interested in the manufacturing process?  If so, you might want to take a look at Engineering Village.  Between these resources, you should be able to find some good articles.

I hope this doesn't sound like a stupid question and thank you in advance!","Thanks for the email and no this isn't a stupid question!  I'm glad you contacted me.      One of the first things that you might want to do is consult some of our online encyclopedias, especially if you don't know much about some of the major issues surrounding marine pollution.  I went to Gale Virtual Reference and looked up ocean AND pollution.  I found many articles about this topic, including some of the legal aspects.  For example, I saw an article on the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988.  This would be quite helpful for exploring the legal concerns of marine pollution.    After you get a good foundation about marine pollution, I would recommend that you find some journal articles for your paper.  Try these resources: ScienceDirect, Academic Search Premier, GreenFILE, General Science Full Text, and Social Sciences Full Text.  The last four resources can be searched simultaneously using the Choose Databases feature in any EBSCO Host database.  See attached picture.    You can see the search that I used, too.  I had 228 results after selecting for Scholarly (peer reviewed) items.      After you've read a few encyclopedic articles, feel free to use some of their topics as your search terms.  For example, you may read about algal blooms and their connection to ocean pollution.  You can then search for algal blooms in conjunction with marine or ocean pollution.      To get to any of the databases I listed above, please do the following:  1) Go to the library's homepage  2) Click on Articles & Databases  3) Click on the corresponding first of the database name (e.g., A for Academic Search Premier, S for ScienceDirect, etc.)  4) Scroll down until you see the name of the database you need  5) Click on the name of the database    You'll see GetText on many of the articles.  Click that to see if we have the article in full text.  If it says ""Full Text Online,"" you can click on that link and access the article right away.      Please let me know if this helps.  I'd be happy to further help!"

I have looked through the database already and am having some trouble looking for articles which are written in a way I understand (some articles I have looked at are very technical and statistical) and I am hoping to find articles which have a good amount of information, but also written in a clear way.","Thanks for the email.  I would recommend that you take a look at ScienceDirect.  It's a great STM (science, technology, and medicine) database.  To get to this database, go to the library's homepage, click on Articles & Databases, S (for ScienceDirect), and then scroll until you see ScienceDirect. This is a huge database, so I would recommend that you click on Advanced Search to specify your search terms and how you want those terms to be searched.      I attached an image of the search I performed.  Basically, I searched for pesticide* and cancer in the title field.  The asterisk on the end of pesticide allows me to find articles with both pesticide and pesticides.  I also put the terms into separate boxes.  I got 55 results and many of them look great.    In general, many of the studies that you'll find on this study will be retrospective, that is the study will find a group of individuals with cancer.  They will then look retrospectively (through questionnaires and mapping of agricultural areas) at the exposures (pesticides) that may have led these individuals to this outcome (cancer).      I attached a couple of articles for you that might highlight this issue a little more clearly.  I also checked PubMed with pesticide* AND cancer.  I restricted to the last 5 years and selected humans.  The articles I attached are those that I found through PubMed.  I like the ones that are available through ScienceDirect, too.    Let me know if this helps and/or if you need more assistance!"

I know it's hard to narrow down a topic, so I understand how difficult it can be when you see all of the articles out there!      There are a number of different topics that you can choose that are related to children and obesity.  Here are some example of potentials subtopics:  * access to fruits and vegetables  * proximity to supermarkets   * school lunch programs  * exercise programs  * frequency of eating  * interventions (what are they, effectiveness?) - perhaps just choose one or two  * psychological aspects that affect diet, like stress  * consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (this one is kind of interesting, especially when you consider growing support for soda taxes)  * consumption of fruits and vegetables    I would also recommend that you narrow down your population.  You are interested in children, but children embodies a wide range of ages.  If your topic is one that is school-related, you could focus on certain grade levels, like 5th-8th graders.      To get some ideas, I think you should take a look at PubMed and/or ScienceDirect and type in children AND obesity.  Scan some of the titles and read some of the abstracts.  See how much research there is on various topics.  Get a sense of how much there is and what is interesting to you.  You can modify your search and paper based on the types of articles and subjects that the authors are investigating.  "

I'm a bit confused about what type of document it is as it is government related with study info as well as a letter to colleagues and lots of legal info.  It seems like a bit of a mixed bag.      What do you think?,"That report would count as a non periodical web document, page, or report. Scroll down to that section on this page for information about citing that kind of source: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/10/  If you only want to cite part of the report check out the ""Chapter/Section of a Web Document or Online Book Chapter"" part of the above web page for directions.      For in text citation it is always the same regardless of what type of document you have. If you have an author you use that, if you don't you use the title or first few words. http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/03/    In general, regardless of what type of document it is, the process is the same. You are just trying to let your reader know all the information you have about your source. If you don't have information for that part of the citation (e.g. no author or date) then you either skip that section (in the case of author) or replace it to make it clear you don't know (put n.d. in place of year for date)"

I was hoping to get your opinion on a research question. I am interested in trying to find out whether or not there is a Chicago school of thought among Chicago-based art critics concerning contemporary art exhibited outside of Chicago.  Can you please recommend a starting place?    ,"  The first thing to do is figure out how many Chicago based art critics there are, and which ones are writing about shows outside of Chicago.  One example I ginned up in the Art Full Text database is Kyle Macmillan, who wrote for the Denver Post for many years but is now based in Chicago.  You can find articles he has written on Art topics by searching AU ""Macmillan, Kyle"" in the Art Full Text database.  Another example I turned up in Art Full Text is writing by Margaret Hawkins, who writes for magazines like American Craft.  Here's her bio:  http://www.chicagoartcriticsassociation.org/B/hawkins.html  The main website for the Chicago Art Critics Assoc noted the group has not been active since 2009, but the list of names might also give you some good options to search in Google and Art Full Text:  http://www.chicagoartcriticsassociation.org/bios.html    Another way to go about this is to search a newspaper database like Lexis Nexis that indexes the Chicago Tribune.  If you limit your results to items from the Chicago Tribune and searched the names of major artists/exhibits in New York/LA/Worldwide, that might give you some names you can then research.    Does that help?"

Here's some of the topics that I chose but gave up on:  1. GMO food and negative effects  2. Soy and cancer  3. Aspartame and negative effects    so far I found a couple for aspartame.. so i'm thinking of just stick to that. i've tried searching 'phenylalanine', and 'artificial sweeteners' so far but I havent found any promising results. And the majority of the articles that I've found so far arent studies, they're just reviews.     What other search terms should I be using? I'm searching for articles in CINAHL.. Pubmed didn't even give me any articles relating to 'phenylalanine' when i used that search word.. Please help!!    ","  Thanks for the message.  Your topics are all very good.  How about trying these two other databases: ScienceDirect and Web of Science?    Between these two, I think you will find a lot of good resources.  For the first topic of GMOs and negative effects, you might want to restrict it to one GMO.  For example, you could take a look at corn, soybeans, or salmon.  This can help to narrow down your topic and find more relevant articles.     I found this great issue in Food and Chemical Toxicology in ScienceDirect on the topic:    http://libaccess.sjlibrary.org/login?url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/02786915/42/7    If you're looking for more clinical materials on the topic, how about this article?    http://libaccess.sjlibrary.org/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reprotox.2011.02.004    These articles are more technical and involve more of the scientific process behind genetic engineering.  One of the difficult aspects to GMOs and their risks is the fact that it's unethical to give people GMOs when you think that there is a danger to their consumption.  So, that's why you'll see a lot of articles about people's attitudes or the levels of vitamin absorption.     Soy and cancer is a good topic, too.  This is the search I performed in PubMed:    soy AND cancer Filters: Clinical Trial; Comparative Study; Multicenter Study; Randomized Controlled Trial; published in the last 5 years; Humans; English    This gave me 62 results and they all looked pretty good.     Aspartame and risks is another viable topic.  When you're looking at negative effects, put in the word risks instead.  In the literature, it'll be more often referred to as a risk than a negative effect.  Also, there may be conflicting evidence, so risks is a more appropriate term.  I found a lot of articles on satiety and aspartame.  This could be an interesting angle, if you wanted to investigate how sugar substitutes could assist/hinder people's caloric intake.     In terms of the reviews, don't despair.  Reviews are great because they give you a nice overview of a topic -- what's been done, the current knowledge, gaps in our understanding of a topic....  They also cite a lot of original research articles, so mine their reference lists for articles!  This is where Web of Science is particularly helpful.  Enter the titles of some of those review articles and then look at their cited and cited by references.  Those references have SJSU GetText embedded, so you'll be able to look for the full text of the articles, too.    Does that help?  Please let me know if you have any further questions!"

PubMed and CINAHL will give you biomedical and clinical articles.  ScienceDirect would give you more scientific and technical articles.  Furthermore, get a sense of how you could continue to narrow down your topic.  Or, determine how you could use some of the articles that you're finding in the databases.  For example, this article http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3437605/ could be used to describe treatment options for milk allergy.    "

Some students set up their library account remotely in which case there is no validated email attached to your account.  If this happens, you can reset by going to circulation on the 1st floor next time you are on campus.    2.

If you're interested in books, I would recommend that you search the catalog with the phrase carnivorous plants.  I think you'll find some good materials on the Venus fly trap.    I attached an entry from the Gale Encyclopedia of Science for the Venus fly trap.     If you're interested in articles, I would suggest you try Academic Search Premier, ScienceDirect, or Web of Science.  Those databases will give you some fairly technical articles, but you might find a good gem or two.  Here are a couple of articles I found in Academic Search Premier and Google Scholar:    http://libaccess.sjlibrary.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=19468982&site=ehost-live  http://ww2.coastal.edu/joluken/pdfs/tbot_134_01_45-52_l.pdf    From these two articles, I think you should be able to find plenty of more materials.  You'll be able to look at the reference list and obtain additional relevant articles.    Please let me know if this works for your assignment!  "

For example, this book looks like a good option    http://discover.sjlibrary.org/iii/encore_sjsu/record/C__Rb2868927?lang=eng    Also, I would recommend that you use these databases: Academic Search Premier, ScienceDirect, and PubMed.  Are you looking for articles that deal directly with human health aspects?  If so, you'd want to focus more on PubMed and ScienceDirect.  PubMed has a lot of articles about the mental health aspects that follow an oil spill.  If this is of interest, I think the two articles that I've attached will be useful.  They and their bibliographies will be of help in arguing the effects of an oil spill on human health.      If you're more interested in effects on marine life and their ability to cope after an oil spill, I think Academic Search Premier and ScienceDirect will be more aligned to that topic.  You could search the specific flora or fauna (e.g., shellfish) and use search phrases like ""oil spills"" AND shellfish AND (population OR health).    "

Unfortunately, I work full time in addition to going to grad school, so scheduling seems to be a challenge.    I thought I'd give you an example of the problem I am trying to solve, which seems to happen frequently.  This is just one example of many, which seems to be inhibiting my research attempts.    Any advice or insight you could give me on how to retrieve these types of article online would be greatly appreciated, and would reduce my frustration greatly.  example part 1 is a cut and paste of the screen that comes up when searched  example 2 is a cut and paste of the screen that comes up when the article is attempted to be retrieved online. It is basically a dead end, and does not result in the actual article being found.","Both of these articles are examples of articles we do not have available electronically through the library. The get text screen is working correctly. If we have the article available online, it will say ""Full Text Online."" Clicking that link should bring you to the article.  If it doesn't you should use the ""Having trouble? Let us know."" link at the bottom of the page as that will provide us with the technical information about the links to look into for you.    For articles we don't have online, we provide a link to look for that journal in the library catalog through the ""May be available in the"" link. If there is a print edition of the journal available at the king library you can see it through that link. Then you need to check if the date of your article matches the date range of our holdings. In both the previous email and this email the item you are looking for is also not in our print collection.    Before I continue I want to make sure you know that the first one is in Masters abstract international, which means it is only an abstract of someone's Master's thesis/project. I do not believe that publication has any research articles. Also, this article ""Internet Videos about Human Trafficking : The Social Construction of a Transnational Problem"" is froma  conference presentation. I was able to find the program which states that the session was a round table session which means it is quite unlikely that there is a full research article created for the proceedings: http://www.asc41.com/Annual_Meeting/programs/2008/2008PrintProgram.pdf     Knowing the above, if you still want to attempt to retrieve the articles, you will have to use the interlibrary loan service provided from the library. From the get text screen you can press the ""request via"" interlibrary loan link to have SFX fill in the form for you. Otherwise, you will need to fill out the form yourself. The first one you should be able to get, the 2nd one may be more tricky as I cannot find evidence that the American Society of Criminology formally publishes their proceedings.    Here are links to two videos about using interlibrary loan and the webpage you can create an account from if you haven't already.  http://library.sjsu.edu/video/interlibrary-services-illiad-creating-account  http://library.sjsu.edu/video/interlibrary-services-illiad-placing-request  http://library.sjsu.edu/interlibrary-services/interlibrary-services-formerly-interlibrary-loan"

I was just wondering, I'm doing a research paper on anything of my choice that has to do with my major. I wanted to look into the history of the olympics and how the event became such a huge success throughout the years. I can't seem to get the right words into the database to find some articles and peer reviewed journals about this topic. Could you help? Just some suggestions on what I should type into the search key or of any other sports related/events that you may think are interesting.     If you have any other questions, please feel free to e-mail me!     ","So, the problem you're probably having is that the Olympics, and even history of the Olympics, is a BIG topic. Journal articles are usually about very narrow topics. So here's what I recommend. Check out steps 1, 2 and 3 before you start. You may be able to jump to 3 if you're ready. You're also make an appointment to come to my office and we can do some searching together.    1. Look at books to get ideas  From the library homepage, I used the Catalog search box and the subject term (put this in exactly as it's typed here) -    Olympics -- History.    There are a number of books and eBooks that might work for you. Scroll past the article results for now - note there are some really good books further down that go over the whole history of the Olympics. Such as    Olympic cities [electronic resource] : city agendas, planning and the world's games, 1896-2016 / edited by John R. Gold and Margaret M. Gold  Global Olympics : historical and sociological studies of the modern games / edited by Kevin Young, Kevin B. Wamsley  The Olympics, a history of the modern games / Allen Guttmann  The Olympic games : a social science perspective / Kristine Toohey and A.J. Veal    And maybe    	    Historical dictionary of the Olympic movement [electronic resource] / Bill Mallon, Jeroen Heijmans    2. Use references and google scholar  Even if you are not looking for books, check out the references/bibliographies at the end of the chapters or books to find the articles they used to write the book. Read the title of the articles they reference - these can give you more ideas about specific topics or articles you may want to look at. You can search for an article by it's title using Google Scholar.    How to use Google Scholar:  Go to scholar.google.com  Login if you have a gmail account. If not, get one.  Go to Settings  Click Library Links  Find San Jose State and set it as your library  Now you can search Google scholar but get the text for free from San Jose State.  Let me know if you find an article you want but can't get    3. Focus your topic to find articles in the library database    You should also look the database called SportsDiscus. Click here to use SportsDiscus - remember, you'll need to enter your Tower card # and library PIN to get in at home.    Use keywords based on your topic, but a little more focused -        If you want to see look at how the Olympics became a global phenomenon, search Olympic games AND global or globalism      Or you may interested in media and the olympics - how did television, newspapers, etc. help it to grow? Use those as key words      Maybe how countries gain pride and standing from the olympics? That would be olympic games AND pride or national pride or nationalism      From the search page you can also limit the results to peer-reviewed journal articles using the checkbox below the search area.    Please let me know if you need more help with finding articles, accessing them or writing your citations."

Articles on dropout rates for Native American in Us would probably do, and whatever else you think is good. The assignment asks for the following: 1. State your research question(s). (5 points)  2. Describe background of your research question(s).    a. Literature review: You must use literature review for this section including   description of what has been found & what remains to be studied (gaps in prior   research).  (5 points)  b. Significance of your study: Using literature review you conducted, you need to   argue a need for studying your research question - e.g., how your proposed   research questions(s) fill the gaps identified above; how your study will contribute   social work practice and research. Practice experience/wisdom can be used to   argue significance of your research question along with literature review – e.g.,   how practice experience informs your scientific inquiry.  (5 points)","Well it looks like you won't have a shortage of gaps in the literature to talk about for this assignment. I was able to find information about Native Americans and various completion issues, but not much about programs that are trying to help solve these problems.    The main database I looked in was Education Research Complete, since your question is primarily an education question.  Below are a list of subject headings that you can use to find articles. They are broken up into two categories, terms that get you to articles about Native Americans, and ones that get you to the dropout problem. Try them in various combinations (e.g. one from the Native American side and one from the other side) to find articles.    Subject Terms  INDIANS of North America -- Education  INDIAN students  INDIAN high school students    academic achievement  achievement gap  school dropouts  school dropouts -- prevention    If you feel like you haven't got enough from Education Research Complete, you can repeat the process I used to find these subject terms in other databases. Basically, I started with a keyword search on native Americans and drop outs and then I looked at the subjects from those results to do further searches which leads to more subjects.    In Education Research Complete, I was unable to find any articles that looked out outreach programs for Native Americans. You might need to look for articles about such outreach programs generally if you need data about that.    Finally, for statistics on drop out rates you can use the database Rand California, which is in the statistics section of the database list on the social work research guide. Once you get into the database, click on Education to see the Education stats they have. The category ""U.S. 9-12 Dropout and Completion Rates (detailed data by State)"" allows you to run reports on the statistics by grade (or all grades) and ethnicity so you can compare enrollment numbers to drop out rates in one or more states."
