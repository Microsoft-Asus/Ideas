In general, the University does not assist in covering publication fees, though I hope that this will change in the future.  For PLos ONE, there is a fee waiver that you can apply for, which basically amounts to checking a box when submitting your paper (http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/).  The waiver does not have any bearing on manuscript acceptance.    If this manuscript is supported by government grants, it is also important to note that many researchers allocate a portion of the award funds towards publication costs.  The NIH and NSF accept publication costs as allowable charges."
