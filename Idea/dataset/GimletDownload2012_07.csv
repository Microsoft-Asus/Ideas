It is seldom that you'd find a peer-reviewed article examining the effectiveness and efficacy of a commercial product.      To complete your assignment, I would suggest the following:    1) Identify the ingredients of your consumer product (which you have already done)  2) Choose a couple of the ingredients and study the effects of these items in the scientific literature (go to the library website and search in CINAHL. Academic Search Premier, PubMed, ScienceDirect)  3) In the online pHion Berry Superfruit ad (http://www.phionbalance.com/ph-balancing-products/antioxidants/phion-berry-superfruit/), there are some citations for the various antioxidant ingredients  4) You could explore some of those citations or search for related articles about the role(s) that these antioxidants may play or conduct searches with some of these possible keywords: [ingredient], efficacy, antioxidant, supplement, etc.  5) Based on the results, refine your searches to find articles that may be of interest.    You're not going to find articles about this product, but you can find articles about the active ingredients in pHion Berry Superfruit."
