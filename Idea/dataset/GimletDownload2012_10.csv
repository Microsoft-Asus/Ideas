I went to the library today in hopes of finding printed or media materials, that contained detailed information about such earthquake, given that it had a devastating magnitude 8.0; much to my surprise there wasn't alot of information. Two of the people at the reference desk on the 2nd floor helped me out to find a PDF file with some details...but no more than that. They tried a crossrefence on the SJSU available databases, but we had no luck.     Will you know how to 'tackle' this particular earthquake? I've also tried the Scholar Google option but came out empty-handed.       The USGS only has this 'brief' note on the topic:"," I did a cross reference using Geological Society of America, GeoRef, Wiley Online Library, and Science Direct.    Keywords: earthquake AND Dominican Republic AND 1946  Results: 79 articles  Relevant Articles: 6 but we only had 1 which I attached and the rest can be requested through Inter Library Services    Second Search: Same databases  Keywords: Hispaniola earthquake 1946  Results: 65  Relevant: About the same as above, most articles are also the same as found above.

If there are 2 fields available, enter one phrase in each field. Otherwise, you can enter them as ""recreation* therapy"" AND ""budget cut*""  You can also use ""job loss"" or unemployment instead of ""budget cut*"" to find information specifically on people loosing jobs in the field. Or try both!    To get only recent results, look to the left or right side of the result list and find Date - you can limit by year to make sure they're current articles.

There aren't many primary sources on food dyes that were published within the last 5 years.  The one I'm recommending is the probably the most targeted towards your topic.  To find other articles, you'll have to broaden your search to food or diet and their connections to hyperactive behaviors.  Unfortunately, you'll have to assess each citation for its applicability to your paper.

Any help would be appreciated.",Her topic was an example of how some topics might not work in every database. Gave suggestions of other places/ways to look for the information

Can you please explain what sources are okay for the scholarly paper? For example, an peer reviewed journal from academic search premier would be considered primary?  ","  Thanks for the email.  A peer-reviewed article is one that has been approved for publication by independent, expert individuals in a field.  This ensures that the contents of articles are of a high quality and meet the standards for publication.    Peer-reviewed articles meet academic and professional standards.  Now, primary and secondary sources that you use in your paper should all be peer-reviewed.  Primary and secondary labels refer to the   content of the articles.    Primary articles are articles where empirical research is being conducted (i.e., observations, readings, data are collected to prove or disprove an idea).

The article you sent referenced the Oakland Tribune and it doesn't seem to have been in print in the Oakland Tribune (We requested an ILL previously for the Oakland Tribune and it showed no results for the particular article.).  We may have been mistaken as to the Oakland Tribune though, so if you can confirm that the article was printed in the Oakland Tribune in the hardcopy newspaper (and what pages, if possible), that would be extremely helpful (and we'll submit a revised ILL).     ","Unfortunately, both the Oakland Tribune and the Contra Costa Times  are online databases only, and  Sjlibrary doesn’t have any  print or microform format holdings  for both newspapers.  Also in searching San Jose Mercury News, I was unable to locale  the article in its database; however, using the ProQuest databases I was able to locate the article in both the Oakland Tribune (October 19, 2010) and in the Contra Costa Time( October 20, 2010).  I have noticed that the citation in the Contra Costa Time has  “Voros, Drew. Contra Costa [ Walnut Creek, Calif] 20 Oct 201: C.2.”  which is a promising that could be in print format  because of the indication  “C.2” section .     "

As you might expect, im finding a lot of articles on why we should avoid products with BPA, but having a hard time finding any contradicting articles. Do you have any suggestions?  I would really appreciate you help. Thank you in advance!","From a manufacturing perspective, you could probably cite a couple of sources about how widespread BPA is in plastic products, canned foods, and infant formula.  This is important, as everyone wants convenience and durability from products.  Also, many people may not know about BPA sources. In terms of effects on humans, instead of looking at ""positives"" of BPA, how about the position that BPA isn't harmful to humans?  A very often cited fact is that humans eliminate a lot of BPA in their urine.  The idea is that if it is being removed from the body, it's not something that lingers for very long.    I have attached a review paper on this topic.  It addresses many of the toxicology and estrogenicity concerns of BPA.    You may also want to consult these resources:     FDA - http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/publichealthfocus/ucm064437.htm  NIEHS - http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa/  CDC - http://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/BisphenolA_BiomonitoringSummary.html    Does that help?  I include the websites because it's important to consider the official government stance on any issue."

I would still need to cite them in APA format. I need to find at least 5 articles, but I currently found only one.  ","Thanks for asking this question.  This is a tough one!  I found an article about smart technology and its applications for strategic directions and roles (it's attached for your convenience).  While searching, I thought that you might be able to search for other concepts.  Since mixers offer a way to improve processing control, perhaps you should look up food processing or mixing.  In Table 3 of the article, ""variable transmission speed of the beater shaft/rotor"" is listed.  These might be alternative terms.      I would also suggest that you look at ScienceDirect.  That looks like another good resource.    I'll keep searching, but hopefully this is a good start!"

I'm sending you the entry on him from  the Oxford Art Online database--the link should prompt you to enter  your student ID and library pin.    Here's an excerpt that is relevant:    ""Mucha shared with his peers the desire to make art popular and  acceptable. In this spirit he co-founded, with Eugène-Samuel Grasset,  René Lalique, Gallé and Horta, the Société Internationale de l’Art  Populaire, and with James McNeill Whistler he founded the Académie  Carmen in 1898 (closed 1901).""    So, one topic you could follow up on would be looking at the work of  those artists.    Another way to look at his work is his advertisements in poster form,  I'm sending you an article from Art Full Text.    I would recommend looking at additional articles in Art Full Text, and  also looking in the catalog for books on posters as well as Art  Nouveau in general.

Once inside, choose the following databases: Academic Search Premier, Communication & Mass Media Complete, Hospitality and Tourism Complete, OmniFile Full Text Mega and SPORTDiscuss    Once you're searching  use the following terms:    1st field - type in ""event planner*"" OR ""party planner*""  2nd field - type in benefit OR value OR ""return on investment"" OR ROI  You may also want to look for these particular journals (type the name in a field with the ""quotation marks"" around the title) -  Journal of convention & event tourism  Special events magazine    For newspapers, magazine and trade journals, try searching the above terms in ProQuest Newsstand, available from the Newspapers and Magazines tab on the HRTM research guide at libguides.sjsu.edu/hospitality    You'll have to do a lot of browsing ... you may also consider rethinking the topic from another angle.

I have spent a lot of time looking for some information about political perspectives about suicide among young adults without success, so I wonder if you can help me. This is for a writing assignment for SW110 with professor Jacobsen. My topic is suicide among young adults.","1st, you can get an overview of the situation, socioloigcally and political from CQ Researcher, then you need to go to the databases to get specific articles.    Notice that there are a couple of major political topics around youth suicide - guns/firearms, LGBT youth, pre-screening by high schools and bullying. You may want to choose one of these angles and focus on it as you search through the results of your article searches. If you have trouble, make an appointment with me and we can work on it together. Here's the step-by-step instructions:    From the library homepage at library.sjsu.edu, go to Articles & Databases on the right side.    Click on C and scroll down until you find CQ Researcher. Click on that. You will need to login with your 9 digit SJSU ID number, name and library PIN number.    CQ Research - search on suicide, look at the reports titled ""Youth Suicide"" and ""Cyberbullying."" This database provides you with lots of information on a topic - look along the left side for options to get background, timelines, pro/con views. There is a CiteNow! button at the top that will help you get a citation for the article.    Next, go back to the Articles & Databases page, click on S and scroll down to Social Sciences Full Text. Click into that.    Once inside the database, click ""Choose Databases"" and add PsychInfo, SOCIndex and ERIC.    Type this into the search fields:  1. youth OR adolescent OR juvenile OR teenage  2. suicide OR suicidal  3. policies OR policy    Limit by peer reviewed and date using the top options on the left.    You can also scroll down and expand the area marked ""Subject"" in the left side to search for subject terms in the databases. These will help refine your search and get your better results once you've decided on an area of interest.  "

The Center for Literary art brochure says its tonight.,"Checked MRM - wasn't booked. Called IRC to check if they're scheduled to film it. Called CLA. Emailed the CLA faculty member in charge: Andrew Altschul <andrew.altschul@sjsu.edu>  Dear Andrew,    I was working the King Library Reference Desk on Wednesday evening, and at least 10 students came looking for the Michael Ryan Reading and Book Signing sponsored by CLA. Since it wasn't in our library meeting schedule system, I figured it was cancelled. But, a few of the students were pretty upset (came with their CLA brochures) because they were counting on seeing this event for an assignment. I'm wondering, since it's impossible to know if something is going to be cancelled when a print brochure is being created, does it say something on the brochure that would encourage folks to perhaps ""check the CLA website for updates or cancellations of events."" Seems like common sense, but apparently - not to these students. That said, I couldn't find the CLA website. So, even if the cancellation was listed there, I couldn't locate it. Please let me know the URL so I can bookmark it.  "

I have been mulling this answer for several days, scratching my head  to think if I have missed an easy answers, but as yet I have not found  a book just about art dealers/galleries of California.    One way to research this would be to look at the sales history of  individual paintings.  Another way would be to search the San  Francisco Chronicle, which we do have as a database from 1865-1922 at  http://libaccess.sjlibrary.org/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpsfchronicle?accountid=10361    Sorry it has taken me so long to write, I think in this case you will  have to go to these type of primary sources if mention is not made in  the books I wrote about earlier."

It might be hard to find enough sources on a commercial artist, as  their work is proprietary and, I suspect, not frequently written about  in academic sources.  What about an artist like Takashi Murakami who  works in several formats and is more well-known?    He edited this book, which we have in the collection:    Little boy: the arts of Japan's exploding subculture / edited by  Takashi Murakami.  New York : Japan Society : New Haven, Conn. ; London : Yale University  Press, 2005.  http://catalog.sjlibrary.org/record=b2624058~S1    Rather than focus on the journal articles for now, I would recommend  starting with the books so you can identify a couple more artists,  then go back to Art Full Text and Academic Search Premiere to research  them.    In the library catalog, there are a lot of good titles under this  subject heading:            Animated films -- Japan -- History and criticism.    Like:    Japanese visual culture [electronic resource] : explorations in the  world of manga and anime / edited by Mark W. MacWilliams ; foreword by  Frederik L. Schodt.Publication Information      Armonk, N.Y. : M.E.  Sharpe, c2008.    Hop into the catalog here:  catalog.sjlibrary.org  and try that  subject heading.  Some of the books are online, some are in print, but  starting on the broader level of Japanese visual culture and  animation/anime/manga should give you a good place to start."

","I would recommend that you first search the following databases:    a) ScienceDirect - it's a great resource on science articles and will provide many of the articles for your pro perspective  b) PubMed - this is a biomedical database and will provide information for some of your con items  c) Academic Search Premier - this is a general database and will offer articles about every related subject.    From searching ScienceDirect, I came across the attached article.  It's a good review (so it's secondary), but it cites some good primary articles, like ""Economic cost of non-adoption of Bt-cotton in West Africa: with special reference to Mali.""    Primary, original articles will generally focus on a specific crop.  I would suggest that you choose a crop and then look for articles on that specific crop.  Examples could include cotton, sorghum, maize, etc.  Also, I would recommend that you take a look at the attached article's bibliography.  There are several primary, original articles that could be helpful for your paper."

I would recommend you use google scholar for this process as google does index titles.  Watch the following video to learn how to set up google scholar so it will link you into the libraries resources: http://library.sjsu.edu/video/customizing-google-scholar    Once you set that up, you can search by the title in google scholar. If the title is pretty generic and you are getting a lot of false hits click on the little arrow in the search bar to open up more advanced search. You can either add in an author if you know that or limit yourself to searching only in the title. Your third option is to put quotations around the title so it will search for it as an exact phrase."

I am researching the history of Japanese American immigration policy in the US, specifically the 1924 Immigration Act and the 1965 Immigration Law.  I am not sure the best data bases to search in.  Can you recommend any?","To find public opinion or other contemporary coverage you can check out historical newspapers and magazines. For 1924 sources for these include JSTOR and ProQuest Historical Newspapers: New York Times. For 1965 you can look in JSTOR as well as ProQuest Newsstand.    For articles about the Act(s) you should check general databases such as Academic Search Premier, as well as subject specific databases such as Social Sciences Full Text, Social Services Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, SocINDEX with FullText, and Political Science Complete.    In all of these places I would search on each of the names (e.g. 1924 immigration act, immigration quota act, Johnson–Reed Act, National Origins Act, Asian Exclusion Act, etc.)    Finally, you can try searching in the library catalog for more resources. I did a search on 1924 immigration act and I found a few books discussing the act, several of which are specifically about the Japanese. You may also want to look for immigration law or immigration history that may place the acts in the larger history of immigration."
