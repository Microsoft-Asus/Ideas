The message you're getting is probably coming from the digital rights that have been assigned by the publisher or the distributor to that particular ebook.  You can check this by looking at the Item Info for the particular ebook that won't transfer.  Here's how you do that:         Go to Library view in ADE.    Then, put your cursor on the small triangle that appears next to the name of the ebook.    A drop-down menu will appear with the choice 'Item Info'.    Click on that bar, and you'll see information about the ebook displayed.    In the middle are the digital rights that have been assigned.    The ebook in question may have a 'Copying: not allowed' setting.  If it does, then there's nothing that you can do via ADE"

Ideally, I would like to incorporate a pre-post type of analysis to help  understand the effectiveness of the app/technology in the classroom.","This is an interesting question and I found a couple of articles that might help. Most of the research seems to have been done internationally, and the terms they're using are ""mobile computing"" or ""mobile learning.""    The first is from Macedonia (!). It's called Assessing Effectiveness in Mobile Learning by Devising MLUAT (Mobile Learning Usability Attribute Testing) Methodology  by Bekim Fetaji, Mirlinda Ebibi, Majlinda Fetaji (INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS Issue 3, Volume 5, 2011). ""Mobile learning"" by their definition is any handheld computer, such as an iPhone or tablet. Their approach is to assess both the user experience and the effectiveness of the application.    The second is: Enrico Bertini, Silvia Gabrielli, and Stephen Kimani. 2006. Appropriating and assessing heuristics for mobile computing.

","According to the following http://forums.adobe.com/thread/945620   Amazon has decided to 'capture' the Kindle and uses proprietary software and digital ebook encoding to keep it linked to Amazon's site only.  AFAIK, Adobe products won't work with or on the Kindle.  I'm not sure that the Kindle supports any Adobe digital formats either.  You may have been toldthat Adobe Digital Editions was 'required' to transfer ebooks to the Kindle because the person or persons who told you that didn't realize that.    There are some independent sources for ebooks in Kindle format, however. If you use them, then you can download the material to your computer directly - not through ADE - and then transfer it to the Kindle using your computer utilities.  One of these sources is gutenberg.org - but theirebooks are generally older.        If you go to our website at http://www.sjpl.org/downloads there are various options for free software to view e-books and other e-materials. You will need to download the software first to your computer before you will be able to access  the materials and you will also need a valid library card and and pin number. It is also important to note that Kindles are limited to OverDrive and Axis 360 with Kindle Fire. There is also a Need Help section on this page with frequently asked questions and tips. "

The goal is to find and explore a current academic research effort regarding the management of electronic records. I've already gone into the Libguides to Library & Information Science, and after a bit of poking around found a note that suggested looking in the Emerald database. I did that and searched on ""management of electronic records"", and ""academic research"" AND ""management of electronic records"" ... where I eventually stumbled upon the following research paper (which sounds promising):    Preserving records in the cloud  Type: Research paper  Author(s): Jan Askhoj, Shigeo Sugimoto, Mitsuharu Nagamori  Source: Records Management Journal Volume: 21 Issue: 3 2011    My search results:   http://www.emeraldinsight.com.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/search.htm?ct=all&st1=""management+of+electronic+records""&fd1=all&mm1=all&bl2=and&st2=&fd2=all&mm2=all&bl3=and&st3=&fd3=all&mm3=all&ys=2010&ye=2013&ec=0&ec=1&bf=0&bf=1&search=Search&cd=ac    The problem is that my approach is a bit haphazard and I would appreciate some insight on how I might better approach this sort of task, where i'm more in control, instead of sort of wandering like a beachcomber and finding things that way. In particular, how could I better approach finding current academic research efforts in records management? ","Hi, John! As you've discovered, research in this area is delightfully (read: ""annoyingly"") dispersed and shows up in a lot of different databases. I've found that Google Scholar is the best place to start when researching for MARA. First, if you haven't already, you want to set up Google Scholar to search across the SJSU databases. Now when you do a search, you'll be looking across all 300+ databases at one time.    Try a search like this one:    (""records management"" OR ""cloud computing"") (universities OR ""higher education"")    In Google, uppercase ""OR"" works just like in a database. (This is just about the only time that case matters in Google.) Putting the phrases in quotes means Google will search on them as a concept rather than as two separate words.    I wasn't sure if you were looking for how universities are using electronic records management or just academic articles on that subject. If it's the latter, you can drop the phrases in the second set of parentheses. As its name suggests, Google Scholar by its nature searches only across the academic literature.    Once you find an article you like and are in the database, look for a link in the article record that says ""Related items"" or ""Similar articles."" This is a quick way to find other articles on the topic you're interested in.    Another approach is to limit your search to particular journals prominent in the records management field. "

If you're looking for food science information (e.g., how foods are fried and how the cooking process translates to more simple sugars, etc.), I would recommend that you identify the cooking technique and pair that with keywords that relate flavor.    For example, fried food* AND flavor* AND sugar* could be a potential search.     Generally speaking, junk food is full of fat and sugars.  From an energy perspective, these are highly desirable by the human body (with respect to our evolutionary background).     Try these resources: Academic Search Premier, Food Science Source, and CINAHL.  Access these via the Articles & Databases page on the library's homepage.  Does this help?  If not, we can work with some of your questions further."

Perhaps, there are letters, or journals that some notable architects and artists have written.",I have sent you some entries on Art Nouveau and some specific artists from the Oxford Reference Databases.

I'm in the year 1 cohort that you did a session for on August 14th. : )  I learned a lot from the session but just wanted to check in with you to see if I could get some tips more specific to my theory paper.  I wanted to write my paper on lack/barriers of breastfeeding in the WIC low-income population.   1. What do you think of the topic?  2. I was wondering if you could give me some tips on maybe some search terms (could it be as simple as ""breastfeeding AND WIC""?) I'm just afraid of maybe getting back too much information for my search.   3. I was also wondering if you would be able to give me some tips on good sites to go to for this topic.  I know that PubMed is one of the best but are there any other journals or sites you think would be good to check out.     On kind of a side note, another topic that I was interested in was the experience of undocumented/illegal immigrants in the U.S. in terms of health and just their overall experience.  That's a topic that I would like to do more research in during my time in the MPH program.  Could you tell me where I might find research on that topic?     Thank you Ms. Peterson for your time! ",""

If you have not changed it, it will not have changed. If your account has been inactive for a while, however, you may need to see circulation services to reactivate the account. You can either go to the circulation desk on the 1st floor of the library or contact them with the information below:  Phone: 1-408-808-2000   Email: circ.sjpl@sjlibrary.org    Google Scholar is not the same as the library website. Google scholar searches a variety of sources which may or may not be available in the library. The link below provides a video that lets you know how you can connect google scholar to the library resources if you prefer to search there.  http://library.sjsu.edu/video/customizing-google-scholar    If you do not search in google scholar, below is my instructions for finding an article at the library when you have the full citation information in the future. The journal for the article given has an embargo period, so it is not available in the library for 18 months after publication, so you will need to request it via interlibrary loan to access it. Here are links to two videos about using interlibrary loan and the webpage you can create an account from if you haven't already.  http://library.sjsu.edu/video/interlibrary-services-illiad-creating-account  http://library.sjsu.edu/video/interlibrary-services-illiad-placing-request  http://library.sjsu.edu/interlibrary-services/interlibrary-services-formerly-interlibrary-loan      1) Click on ejournals tab in search bar on the library homepage  2) Search by journal title to see if we have your issue available electronically, if  we do double check that the year range matches the year of your citation. Open the link that matches and navigate to your year/volume to find the article.  3) Check the library catalog for print versions if we don't have it electronically.  Look for the journal title without [electronic access] to locate what we have available in print on the lower level of the library. Check the line that says ""library has..."" to make sure we have your year. Print journals can't be taken out of the library, so bring a usb drive to scan the article or change to make copies at 20 cents a page.  4) Request via interlibrary loan if we don't have it electronically or in print."
