If there is no way to cite the personal story, how would I include my story in?","Since you're the author, you don't have to cite your personal story.  Citing is necessary if you're writing something that is can be disproved.  Basically, you're providing a citation for your reader to check on the sources that you consulted.  If this is a personal story, no one can really check the veracity of your statements.  In terms of how you treat it in your paper you can write in the body of the paper something like, ""The author experienced this situation as a child...""      Now, if you were conducting an interview or had corresponded with someone, then you would cite in-text the name of the individual, indicate that it was personal communication, and note the date.  See this example from the OWL at Purdue.      http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/11/    I hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any further questions.  "

In terms of where you should search for the topic, I would recommend the following databases for articles:  Social Sciences Full Text      Social Services Abstracts      Sociological Abstracts      SocINDEX with FullText        To find a focus you could also look for your topic in the database and browse through the articles to see if something is interesting to you and form your thesis based off of that.

I am taking a Theorie class here that will be transferrable to a couple upper-division art history courses.  I need some help.  I need to find a book or articles relating to why designers choose to design something modern.  Or what is modern?  The psychology behind Contemporary design.  As well as California Architecture.  Do you have any suggestions?,"  I'll be happy to help you.  First of all, do you know your student id  and library pin?  If so, you will be able to access the full text  journal article databases on this webpage:     http://libguides.sjsu.edu/design    The databases that are likely to be most helpful to you are Art Full  Text and JSTOR.  Within those databases, citations that are not full  text have a link marked ""Get Text"" that will link to our databases.    You will probably need to narrow your topic down somewhat, or maybe  you have two separate questions.  Are you researching designers or  architects?  And, are you looking at commercial or domestic  architecture.    Here's an example of a citation that is about an article that  discusses the architect Joseph Eichler and his impact on California  architecture:      Solomon, Daniel  Source:  Places: Forum of Design for the Public Realm; Fall2001, Vol. 14 Issue  2, p38-45, 8p    Subjects:  California; Eichler, Joseph; American architecture -- History -- 20th  century; Dwellings -- History; Domestic architecture; Open plan  (Building)  Abstract:  The writer discusses the postwar houses designed by Joseph Eichler.  Eichler's formula for his houses was comprised in equal parts of the  Case Study House, a fantasy housing program during the war, and  Levittown, Long Island, a model of rationalized mass production of  housing for the G.I. Bill. While his houses looked like modest  versions of the Case Study Houses, their timber, plywood, light wood  framing and particle board, were more like the houses of Levittown.    http://libaccess.sjlibrary.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aft&AN=504979556&site=ehost-live    Another way to investigate the topic is to look at the corporations  that were forming and their methods.  Here's an article that discusses  several examples:    Journal of Design History Volume 19, Issue 3Pp. 233-248  This Year's Model  Representing Modernism to the Post-war American Corporation  http://jdh.oxfordjournals.org.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/content/19/3/233.full?sid=8f7be0e7-d2ef-467e-a980-9e37465251a8    Please write back with more thoughts about what you would like to  find, and also whether or not the above links let you see the full  text of the articles."

I have some articles already in place, however, I'm getting a lot of method articles about which therapy is better or articles about incarcerated parents and I realize that I don't have enough references to back up what I want to talk about. I'm feeling overwhelmed in the amount of information out there and wondering if they are relevant.    Do you have any tips that you can give me to help me narrow down my topic or find more relevant articles? It would really help me streamline my paper.",Gave suggestions on how to hone in the overall thesis. Made a 5 minute video demoing how to do a specified search for specific articles rather than broad searches covering the whole topic.
