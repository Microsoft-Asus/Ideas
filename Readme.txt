If something is unclear for you, you can always find more specific examples
in the following locations:
	Anaconda: http://continuum.io/
	NLTK: http://nltk.org/
	Ipython: http://ipython.org/



MAC AND LINUX 
Installation on Mac\Linux is fairly simple for people who are familiar with
	basic command line administration. 
1. Install Anaconda using the provided installer package.
	Set it as a default python interpreter or switch to its environment.
2. Install stopwords dictionary for nltk using the following command:
	python -m nltk.downloader stopwords
3. Copy the notebook files and IDEA backend to the desired location.
	Run Ipython Notebook from that location.	


WINDOWS
For windows Users the installation process is fairly simple: just run the Install_Idea_Distributive.bat.
The file will go though all the necessary steps and will install the IDEA software.

There are also two other files which one may find usefull when using IDEA:
1. Save_Local_Files_on_Flashdrive.bat - Is used to automatically copy your local notebooks onto the flashdrive.
2. Copy_Files_From_Flashdrive_to_Disk.bat - Is used to automatically copy notebooks from flashdrive onto your computer.

Note: Save_Local_Files_on_Flashdrive.bat only copies your notebooks, while restore updates the dataset too.
	Make sure the flashdrive always has the latest dataset


Typical use case is:
0. Install IDEA for your operating system if you haven't done so. 
1. Create a new notebook or use an existing one to explore the dataset.
	Please note that one should not delete existing information from the notebook, but
	rather should append his or her own research.
2. Save your research using the backup.bat file onto the flashdrive and pass it on.

It is always a good idea to create your own notebook files to prevent accidental loss of
valuable research information.
